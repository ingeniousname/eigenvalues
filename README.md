# eigenvalues
Numerical methods project

An university project about calculating eigenvalues. Implemented function uses the inverse power method with normalization applied to a tridiagonal matrix. The matrix is first triangularized using Givens rotations, and then in each iteration a system of linear equations is solved optimized for the tridiagonal matrix case.

More details explained in P2Z45_* file (POLISH).

Program developed in MATLAB environment.
